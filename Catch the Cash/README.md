A summary of the project goals
  To better understand simpleGE and pull together all of my knowledge from the entire course
Instructions the player may need
  WAD keys to move, Left Shift to sprint, mouse to hover over and stop/slow enemies. Push buttons to kill boss
A list of technologies and techniques you used
  used simpleGE and pygame
Citations for any external resources you used
  Used Universal LPC Spritesheet Generator to generate the enemies and boss, JSFXR to create sounds, my friend Eli drew all of the rest of the designs and took photos of me
What did you learn?
	How important the game design document is. I had a very detailed one and it helped me fly through the simpler code and get straight to debugging, which took a long time
Where did you get stuck?
	The debugging, mainly making the sounds happen consistently
What would you like to improve?
	Consistent results when the player collides with the door from different sides/speeds
How would you do things differently next time?
	Get started coding sooner. I didn’t expect it to be dramatically longer than every coding assignment we’ve done
	Make more functions rather than code to solve a problem over and over again (although I’m proud of the ones I did make)
How far did you stray from the game design document?
	My initial plan for killing the boss (jumping on its head) wasn’t realistic so I added buttons in the final screen
How did you stay on track?
	The mechanics of the rooms, especially the climbing one. I thought have all of the things spawn off screen and move in was clever rather than trying to make them appear and disappear. It did mean I had to be specific with the way gravity worked
